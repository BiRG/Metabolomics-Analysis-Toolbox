* The problem: extracting parameters in congested regions

** Why is extracting parameters in congested spectra important

*** Biofluid analysis is growing in importance

**** Metabolomics

**** Food analysis (for example, wine)

*** Biofluids are usually complex mixtures

*** Many complex mixtures have congested regions
