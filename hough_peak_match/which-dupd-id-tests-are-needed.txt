IDs are duplicated when:

Any of the subclasses has the same id.  For peaks, it is the same sample_id and peak_id

For the peaks, we also need valid databases where the peaks have the different sample_ids but the same peak_ids -- one for each pair

So we need:

Peak:
human+unv
human+human
human+unk
unv+unv
unv+unk
unk+unk

peak_group:
det+det
det+param
param+param

sample:
sample+sample
