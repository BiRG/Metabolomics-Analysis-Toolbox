# Basic test data: all peaks are known and unverified, 5 peaks
# 3 samples, and 1 parameters in both the peaks and the 
# samples.
#
# The peaks are generated uniformly in the interval 0..11 and their
# reaction parameters are all zero-mean unit width Gaussians.  The
# sample parameters are also zero-mean unit width Gaussians.  All
# parameters are chosen independently.
#
# The peak group and sample parameters explain the peak locations
# commpletely, there is no noise.
#
# The blank line below serves as separating white-space and also
# helps test that the program ignores blank lines

# In this data set I have removed the information for peak groups 2
# and 3 and the sample parameter data - this is input for
# hough_sample_params

# This file contains a simulation of what the output of *.initial
# would be after being run through hough_sample_params.  Note that the
# ordering of the items in the file should not matter, so I've swapped
# it around a bit.  The eventual code will probably always write
# things in the same order.
