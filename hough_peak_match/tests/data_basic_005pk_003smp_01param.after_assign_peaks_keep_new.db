# Basic test data: all peaks are known and unverified, 5 peaks
# 3 samples, and 1 parameters in both the peaks and the 
# samples.
#
# The peaks are generated uniformly in the interval 0..11 and their
# reaction parameters are all zero-mean unit width Gaussians.  The
# sample parameters are also zero-mean unit width Gaussians.  All
# parameters are chosen independently.
#
# The peak group and sample parameters explain the peak locations
# commpletely, there is no noise.
#
# The blank line below serves as separating white-space and also
# helps test that the program ignores blank lines

# This file contains a simulation of what the output of
# *.after_simple_hough would be after being run through assign_peaks
# with the keep_new_groups option.  I will have to make some slight
# modifications when I run the actual code to account for variations
# in the detected groups, but I expect them to be close to this.  I'm
# assuming, of course, in all this that the program is sufficiently
# powerful to properly detect the peaks.
