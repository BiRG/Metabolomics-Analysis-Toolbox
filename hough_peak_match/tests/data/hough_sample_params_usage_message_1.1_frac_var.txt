Synopsis: hough_sample_params [options] fractionVariance < initial_db > db_with_sample_params

Reads a peak database from standard input. Extracts the set 
of peak_groups that have a representative in every sample. 
Creates a set of sample parameters that accounts for at least 
fractionVariance [0..1] of the variance of the peaks in those 
peak groups. Outputs a database with these new sample parameters 
along with a param_stats object added.

If there are already sample_params objects in the database, then 
three things differ. First, the number of parameters is set to be 
the same as the number of parameters in the existing objects. 
Second, only samples not associated with an extant sample_params 
object are given new sample_params objects. Third, the 
param_stats object will be updated.

Options:
  --remove-sample-params  removes all sample_params objects from the 
                          input database before processing it.

ERROR: fraction of variance must be between 0 and 1, inclusive.  You wrote: 1.1
