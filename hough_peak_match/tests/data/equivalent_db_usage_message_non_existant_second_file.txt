Synopsis: equivalent_db database_1 database_2

Reads the two given peak database files and reports whether 
they describe equivalent databases, that is, databases that 
describe the same real-world information but with file-level 
differences like changes in line ordering or in object id numbers.

Writes to standard output, prints:
    "Databases ARE equivalent" if the databases are equivalent,
    "Databases ARE NOT equivalent" if the databases are not 
                                     equivalent

ERROR: Could not open the second database "non_existent_file_yes"
