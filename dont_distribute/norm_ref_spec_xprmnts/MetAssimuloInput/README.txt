Here are the input directories that I linked under the MetAssimulo
directory to generate the inputs for testing the accuracy of different
normalization methods.

OriginalInput 
 - the directory as shipped with MetAssimulo

ExperimentInput
 - The directory with the parameter files I used to generate the
   different spectra for my first experiment

 - used to create the 2 groups of 200 "control" spectra.

 - used to create the first treatment group - with one metabolite
   upregulated slightly

 - used to create the second treatment group - with one metabolite
   upregulated greatly

 - used to create the third treatment group - with ten metabolites
   upregulated greatly

 - used to create the fourth treatment group - with 7 metabolites
   upregulated greatly and 8 downregulated greatly.
