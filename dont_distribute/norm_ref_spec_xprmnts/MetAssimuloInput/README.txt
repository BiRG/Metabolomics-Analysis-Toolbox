This directory has the parameter files I used to generate the
 different spectra for my first experiment testing the accuracy of
 different dilution normalization methods.

 - used to create the 2 groups of 200 "control" spectra.

 - used to create the first treatment group - with one metabolite
   upregulated slightly

 - used to create the second treatment group - with one metabolite
   upregulated greatly

 - used to create the third treatment group - with ten metabolites
   upregulated greatly

 - used to create the fourth treatment group - with 7 metabolites
   upregulated greatly and 8 downregulated greatly.
