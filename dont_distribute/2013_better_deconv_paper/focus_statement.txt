Deconvolution is essential to accurate quantitation of NMR data. I
improve Paul Anderson's deconvolution algorithm by changing the part
that calculates the search starting point. I demonstrate the
improvement by showing some portions of real spectra that cannot be
deconvolved using the old starting point and by deconvolving a simple
simulation of random peaks with both methods.
