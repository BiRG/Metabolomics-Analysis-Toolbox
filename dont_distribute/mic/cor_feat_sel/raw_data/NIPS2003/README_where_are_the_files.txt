I have decided not to commit the GISETTE data to the repository
because it is so large.

It should reside in the directory GISETTE and consist of the files:

gisette.param       gisette_train.labels  gisette_valid.labels  UCIGisette.html
gisette_train.data  gisette_valid.data

As of this writing, the data set is available at the UCI Machine
Learning repository at:
