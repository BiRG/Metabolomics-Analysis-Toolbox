Here is all the data files (or placeholders for holding the data) that
I use in the performance analysis.

To use, first go to the NIPS2003 directory and download the missing
files (see the readme there). Then, come back to the raw_data directory and run
make_all_initial_files.sh.

This will populate ../processed_data
