This holds a program that calculates the exact Mutual Information
Coefficient (Rashef Dec 2011) using the CHOCO constraint-satisfaciton
program solver.

The program is an Eclipse project.  I was using: Indigo Service Release 1
Build id: 20110916-0149

The CHOCO solver is assumed to be in /home/eric/SW/CHOCO/choco/choco-solver-2.1.2-with-sources.jar

You'll need to change things to compile it on your machine.
